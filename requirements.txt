# This custom node package relies on the lc_python_core package.
# Currently, lc_python_core must be installed separately or made available
# in the PYTHONPATH (e.g., by adding 'lab/frontends/' to PYTHONPATH).
# Future work will involve making lc_python_core a pip-installable package.
#
# For lc_python_core itself, the following dependencies are needed by the services these nodes use:
# pydantic>=1.10,<2.0 # Assuming Pydantic v1 for now due to potential 'constr' issues, adjust if v2 is confirmed compatible
# requests>=2.20.0
# playwright>=1.20.0
#
# After installing playwright via pip, browser binaries must also be installed:
# playwright install
../lc_python_core
